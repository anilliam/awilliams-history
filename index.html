  <h2>About me</h2>
 
  <p style="text-align: justify;">My name is Andrew Williams. I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarborough,_North_Yorkshire">Scarborough, North Yorkshire</a> in 1999, and I grew up just outside the town in a village called Crossgates. I went to sixth form in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbach">Sandbach, Cheshire</a>, and from 2018&ndash;21 I attended Lancaster University and graduated with a <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/history-and-politics-ba-hons-lv21/">BA (Hons) in History and Politics</a>. I worked as a Collections Assistant at the <a href="https://vgm.liverpool.ac.uk/">Victoria Gallery &amp; Museum</a>, part of the University of Liverpool, from 2021&ndash;22, on a one-year fixed-term contract.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">Since August 2022, I have been a postgraduate research student at the University of the West Indies, Mona, in Jamaica, registered for a <a href="https://www.mona.uwi.edu/history/mphil-history">Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in History</a>. I am supported by a <a href="https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/study-abroad-studentships">Study Abroad Studentship</a> from the Leverhulme Trust.</p>
